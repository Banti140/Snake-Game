Those who are interested in making something easier in your domain can definitely try this out
and the module Turtle was made exactly for this purpose for the beginners to try out and can
also submit as a part of the project. This program will be done in Python 3.
So, I created a Python-based-game using the following modules:
1. Turtle: It is a pre-installed python library that enables users to create shapes and pictures by
providing them a virtual canvas.
2. Time: This function is used to count the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch.
3. Random: This function is used to generate random numbers in Python by using a random
module.

# Support :-

The following code can be easily done using the PyCharm application which is specially made
for Python programs. Also, VSCode can be used for this program. Install Python3 from extensions of VSCode. Then,
save the program in the form of your_filename.py .

## Below is the step-by-step Approach to create a Snake Game using Turtle module: -

Step 1: We will be importing modules into the program and giving default values for the game.

Step 2: Now, we will be creating the display of the game, i.e, the window screen for the game
where we will create the head of the snake and food for the snake in the game and displaying
the scores at the header of the game.

Step 3: Now, we will be validating the key for the snake’s movements. By clicking the keywords
normally used for gaming ‘Up’, ‘Down’, ‘Left’ and ‘Right’, we can operate the snake’s
movements around the screen.

Step 4: Now, lastly, we will create the gameplay where the following will be happening:
The snake will grow its body when the snake eats the fruits.

Giving color to the snake’s tail.
--After the fruit is eaten, the score will be counted.

--Checking for the snake’s head collisions with the body or the wall of the window screen.

--Restarting the game automatically from the start after the collision.

--The new shape and color of the fruit will be introduced every time the window is restarted.

--The score will be returned to zero and a high score will be retained until the window is not
closed.
